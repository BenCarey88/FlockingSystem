# FlockingSystem

Basic Flocking System, needs pygame to run. I made this after first implementing a flocking system in houdini by following the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUec3GXc6Tg, so some of the implementation follows the methods presented there.

Currently a work in progess - doesn't have boundary conditions yet, and could do with some neatening up and improving efficiency
